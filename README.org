* Org Agenda Dashboard

This is a fork of Nicolas Rougier's [[https://github.com/rougier/mu4e-dashboard][mu4e dashboard]]. This fork piggybacks on his excellent
ideas and implementation to provide an org link type to search queries in org agenda.
These agenda searches can be openend by clicking the link. These links can be organised in
a simple org file as in the left side window in the following image:

** Installation

Evaluate the buffer and you're good to go. It is your responsibility to
write an org file with links pointing to various queries on your agenda.

** Configuration

*** Links

The link syntax is quite intuitive:

#+begin_src org
[[orgdash:query|org-agenda-files|format][description]]
#+end_src

=query= must be a valid org agenda search query. For example, the following query searches
for TODO items in the file =projects.org= and returns a view on all items with the
=GROUP=Admin= property:

#+begin_src org
[[orgdash:TODO="TODO"+GROUP="Admin"|~/org/projects.org][Admin]]
#+end_src

Similarly, the following query searches for all TODO entries with the tag =writing=:

#+begin_src org
[[orgdash:TODO="TODO"+writing][#writing]]
#+end_src

Note that here we don't specify the agenda file, in which case all agenda files are
searched.

=format= can be used to specify that =query= results are to be counted in
order to update the descritption using the given format:

#+begin_src org
  [[orgdash:TODO="TODO"+GROUP="Students"|~/org/projects.org|(%d)][(1)]]
#+end_src


*** Key bindings

Keybindings can be configured using the =KEYMAP= keyword in your org file:

#+begin_src org
#+KEYMAP: key | elisp function
#+end_src

** Usage

To activate the dashboard, type =org-agenda-dashboard-mode=. This will turn on
=org-agenda-dashboard-mode= minor mode and install any custom keybindings in
the current buffer.

To edit the org file, you'll need to turn off =org-agenda-dashboard-mode=.
